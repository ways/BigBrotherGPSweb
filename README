**DISCONTINUED**

== Overview ==

BigBrotherGPS ( http://bk.gnarf.org/creativity/bigbrothergps/ ) is an Open Source app for regularily reporting location to a server.

== BigBrotherWebUI (this project ) == 
... is serverside code for the app. An improved receiver using MySQL, and a webUI with OpenStreetMap.

This allows for:
* open source,
* self hosted,
* non-google,
* private,
 location reporting/sharing.

== Uses ==
* Outdated android phones can be put to use again.
* One can track cars, boats, motorbikes, caravans and other large items with a powersource.
* One can track people, animals.

== Limitations ==
* One needs a SIM-card for data traffic (or rely on accessable, wifi networks).
* The battery of the phone will limit your uptime if you don't have a powersource.

== Other possibilities ==
* Protocol is open and very basic, so people with skills can implement apps for other phones. A bash client for linux is included.

== Current status ==
